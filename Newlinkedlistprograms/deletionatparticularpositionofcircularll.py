'''
To delete a node at a particular position of a circular linked list in Python, you need to follow these steps:

Check if the list is empty. If it is empty, there is nothing to delete.
If the position is 0, it means deleting the head node. In this case, update the next pointer of the last node to point to the second node and update the head.
Traverse the list to find the node at the desired position (index â€“ 1).
Update the next pointer of the current node to skip the node to be deleted (pointing to the next node of the node to be deleted).
Optionally, free the memory allocated to the deleted node.
