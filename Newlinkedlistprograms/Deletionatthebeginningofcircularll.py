'''
To delete the node at the beginning of a circular linked list in Python, you need to follow these steps:

Check if the list is empty. If it is empty, there is nothing to delete.
If the list has only one node, set the head to None to delete the node.
Otherwise, find the last node of the list (the node whose next pointer points to the head).
Update the next pointer of the last node to point to the second node (headâ€™s next).
Update the head to point to the second node.
Optionally, free the memory allocated to the deleted node.
