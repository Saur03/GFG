Kâ€™th Non-repeating Character
Given a string str of length n (1 <= n <= 106) and a number k, 
the task is to find the kth non-repeating character in the string.

Examples: 

Input : str = geeksforgeeks, k = 3
Output : r
Explanation: First non-repeating character is f, second is o and third is r.

Input : str = geeksforgeeks, k = 2
Output : o
