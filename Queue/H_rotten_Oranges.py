'''
Rotten Oranges â€“ Minimum Time Required to Rot All
Given a matrix of dimension M * N, where each cell in the matrix can have values 0, 1 or 2 which has the following meaning:  

0: Empty cell
1: Cells have fresh oranges
2: Cells have rotten oranges
The task is to the minimum time required so that all the oranges become rotten. A rotten orange at index (i,j ) can rot other fresh oranges which are its neighbors (up, down, left, and right). If it is impossible to rot every orange then simply return -1.

Examples: 

Input:  arr[][C] = { {2, 1, 0, 2, 1}, {1, 0, 1, 2, 1}, {1, 0, 0, 2, 1}};
Output: 2
Explanation: At 0th time frame:
{2, 1, 0, 2, 1}
{1, 0, 1, 2, 1}
{1, 0, 0, 2, 1}
At 1st time frame:
{2, 2, 0, 2, 2}
{2, 0, 2, 2, 2}
{1, 0, 0, 2, 2}
At 2nd time frame:
{2, 2, 0, 2, 2}
{2, 0, 2, 2, 2}
{2, 0, 0, 2, 2}

Input:  arr[][C] = { {2, 1, 0, 2, 1}, {0, 0, 1, 2, 1}, {1, 0, 0, 2, 1}}
Output: -1
Explanation: At 0th time frame:
{2, 1, 0, 2, 1}
{0, 0, 1, 2, 1}
{1, 0, 0, 2, 1}
At 1st time frame:
{2, 2, 0, 2, 2}
{0, 0, 2, 2, 2}
{1, 0, 0, 2, 2}
At 2nd time frame:
{2, 2, 0, 2, 2}
{0, 0, 2, 2, 2}
{1, 0, 0, 2, 2}
The 1 at the bottom left corner of the matrix is never rotten.
