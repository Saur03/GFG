'''
Maximum cost path from source node to destination node via at most K intermediate nodes

Given a directed weighted graph consisting of N vertices and an array Edges[][], 
with each row representing two vertices connected by an edge and the weight of that edge, 
the task is to find the path with the maximum sum of weights from a given source vertex src 
to a given destination vertex dst, made up of at most K intermediate vertices. 

If no such path exists, then print -1.

Examples:

Input: N = 3, Edges[][] = {{0, 1, 100}, {1, 2, 100}, {0, 2, 500}}, src = 0, dst = 2, K = 0
Output: 500
Explanation:
Path 0 â†’ 2: The path with maximum weight and at most 0 intermediate nodes is of weight 500.
